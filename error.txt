More specifically, it is a deca-2_8-dienoic acid thioester of coenzyme A. (2,8)-decadienoyl-coa is an acyl-CoA with 10 fatty acid group as the acyl moiety attached to coenzyme A. Coenzyme A was discovered in 1946 by Fritz Lipmann (Journal of Biological Chemistry (1946) 162 (3): 743\u2013744) and its structure was determined in the early 1950s at the Lister Institute in London. Coenzyme A is a complex, thiol-containing molecule that is naturally synthesized from pantothenate (vitamin B5), which is found in various foods such as meat, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, eggs, and milk. More specifically, coenzyme A (CoASH or CoA) consists of a beta-mercaptoethylamine group linked to the vitamin pantothenic acid (B5) through an amide linkage and 3'-phosphorylated ADP. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process that requires four molecules of ATP, pantothenate and cysteine. It is believed that there are more than 1100 types of acyl-CoA\u2019s in the human body, which also corresponds to the number of acylcarnitines in the human body. Acyl-CoAs exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. The general role of acyl-CoA\u2019s is to assist in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. This process facilitates the production of fatty acids in cells, which are essential in cell membrane structure. Acyl-CoA's are also susceptible to beta oxidation, forming, ultimately, acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can enter the citric acid cycle, eventually forming several equivalents of ATP. In this way, fats are converted to ATP -- or biochemical energy. Acyl-CoAs can be classified into 9 different categories depending on the size of their acyl-group: 1) short-chain acyl-CoAs; 2) medium-chain acyl-CoAs; 3) long-chain acyl-CoAs; and 4) very long-chain acyl-CoAs; 5) hydroxy acyl-CoAs; 6) branched chain acyl-CoAs; 7) unsaturated acyl-CoAs; 8) dicarboxylic acyl-CoAs and 9) miscellaneous acyl-CoAs. Short-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with two to four carbons (C2-C4), medium-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with five to eleven carbons (C5-C11), long-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with twelve to twenty carbons (C12-C20) while very long-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl groups with more than 20 carbons. (2,8)-decadienoyl-coa is therefore classified as a medium chain acyl-CoA. The oxidative degradation of fatty acids is a two-step process, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase/synthase. Fatty acids are first converted to their acyl phosphate, the precursor to acyl-CoA. The latter conversion is mediated by acyl-CoA synthase. Three types of acyl-CoA synthases are employed, depending on the chain length of the fatty acid. (2,8)-decadienoyl-coa, being a medium chain acyl-CoA is a substrate for medium chain acyl-CoA synthase. The second step of fatty acid degradation is beta oxidation. Beta oxidation occurs in mitochondria and, in the case of very long chain acyl-CoAs, the peroxisome. After its formation in the cytosol, (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA is transported into the mitochondria, the locus of beta oxidation. Transport of (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA into the mitochondria requires carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which converts (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA into (2_8)-Decadienoylcarnitine, which gets transported into the mitochondrial matrix. Once in the matrix, (2_8)-Decadienoylcarnitine is converted back to (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA by CPT2, whereupon beta-oxidation can begin. Beta oxidation of (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA occurs in four steps. First, since (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA is a medium chain acyl-CoA it is the substrate for a medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes dehydrogenation of (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA, creating a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. FAD is the hydrogen acceptor, yielding FADH2. Second, Enoyl-CoA hydrase catalyzes the addition of water across the newly formed double bond to make an alcohol. Third, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase oxidizes the alcohol group to a ketone and NADH is produced from NAD+. Finally, Thiolase cleaves between the alpha carbon and ketone to release one molecule of acetyl-CoA and a new acyl-CoA which is now 2 carbons shorter. This four-step process repeats until (2,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA has had all its carbons removed from the chain, leaving only acetyl-CoA. Beta oxidation, as well as alpha-oxidation, also occurs in the peroxisome. The peroxisome handles beta oxidation of fatty acids that have more than 20 carbons in their chain because the peroxisome contains very-long-chain Acyl-CoA synthetases and dehydrogenases. The heart primarily metabolizes fat for energy and Acyl-CoA metabolism has been identified as a critical molecule in early-stage heart muscle pump failure. Cellular acyl-CoA content also correlates with insulin resistance, suggesting that it can mediate lipotoxicity in non-adipose tissues. Acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) plays an important role in energy metabolism on account of key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis. The study of acyl-CoAs is an active area of research and it is likely that many novel acyl-CoAs will be discovered in the coming years. It is also likely that many novel roles in health and disease will be uncovered for these molecules.", "attr_mul": "{}", "attr_other": "{}"}

More specifically, it is a deca-2_7-dienoic acid thioester of coenzyme A. (2,7)-decadienoyl-coa is an acyl-CoA with 10 fatty acid group as the acyl moiety attached to coenzyme A. Coenzyme A was discovered in 1946 by Fritz Lipmann (Journal of Biological Chemistry (1946) 162 (3): 743\u2013744) and its structure was determined in the early 1950s at the Lister Institute in London. Coenzyme A is a complex, thiol-containing molecule that is naturally synthesized from pantothenate (vitamin B5), which is found in various foods such as meat, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, eggs, and milk. More specifically, coenzyme A (CoASH or CoA) consists of a beta-mercaptoethylamine group linked to the vitamin pantothenic acid (B5) through an amide linkage and 3'-phosphorylated ADP. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process that requires four molecules of ATP, pantothenate and cysteine. It is believed that there are more than 1100 types of acyl-CoA\u2019s in the human body, which also corresponds to the number of acylcarnitines in the human body. Acyl-CoAs exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. The general role of acyl-CoA\u2019s is to assist in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. This process facilitates the production of fatty acids in cells, which are essential in cell membrane structure. Acyl-CoA's are also susceptible to beta oxidation, forming, ultimately, acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can enter the citric acid cycle, eventually forming several equivalents of ATP. In this way, fats are converted to ATP -- or biochemical energy. Acyl-CoAs can be classified into 9 different categories depending on the size of their acyl-group: 1) short-chain acyl-CoAs; 2) medium-chain acyl-CoAs; 3) long-chain acyl-CoAs; and 4) very long-chain acyl-CoAs; 5) hydroxy acyl-CoAs; 6) branched chain acyl-CoAs; 7) unsaturated acyl-CoAs; 8) dicarboxylic acyl-CoAs and 9) miscellaneous acyl-CoAs. Short-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with two to four carbons (C2-C4), medium-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with five to eleven carbons (C5-C11), long-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with twelve to twenty carbons (C12-C20) while very long-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl groups with more than 20 carbons. (2,7)-decadienoyl-coa is therefore classified as a medium chain acyl-CoA. The oxidative degradation of fatty acids is a two-step process, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase/synthase. Fatty acids are first converted to their acyl phosphate, the precursor to acyl-CoA. The latter conversion is mediated by acyl-CoA synthase. Three types of acyl-CoA synthases are employed, depending on the chain length of the fatty acid. (2,7)-decadienoyl-coa, being a medium chain acyl-CoA is a substrate for medium chain acyl-CoA synthase. The second step of fatty acid degradation is beta oxidation. Beta oxidation occurs in mitochondria and, in the case of very long chain acyl-CoAs, the peroxisome. After its formation in the cytosol, (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA is transported into the mitochondria, the locus of beta oxidation. Transport of (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA into the mitochondria requires carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which converts (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA into (2_7)-Decadienoylcarnitine, which gets transported into the mitochondrial matrix. Once in the matrix, (2_7)-Decadienoylcarnitine is converted back to (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA by CPT2, whereupon beta-oxidation can begin. Beta oxidation of (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA occurs in four steps. First, since (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA is a medium chain acyl-CoA it is the substrate for a medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes dehydrogenation of (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA, creating a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. FAD is the hydrogen acceptor, yielding FADH2. Second, Enoyl-CoA hydrase catalyzes the addition of water across the newly formed double bond to make an alcohol. Third, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase oxidizes the alcohol group to a ketone and NADH is produced from NAD+. Finally, Thiolase cleaves between the alpha carbon and ketone to release one molecule of acetyl-CoA and a new acyl-CoA which is now 2 carbons shorter. This four-step process repeats until (2,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA has had all its carbons removed from the chain, leaving only acetyl-CoA. Beta oxidation, as well as alpha-oxidation, also occurs in the peroxisome. The peroxisome handles beta oxidation of fatty acids that have more than 20 carbons in their chain because the peroxisome contains very-long-chain Acyl-CoA synthetases and dehydrogenases. The heart primarily metabolizes fat for energy and Acyl-CoA metabolism has been identified as a critical molecule in early-stage heart muscle pump failure. Cellular acyl-CoA content also correlates with insulin resistance, suggesting that it can mediate lipotoxicity in non-adipose tissues. Acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) plays an important role in energy metabolism on account of key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis. The study of acyl-CoAs is an active area of research and it is likely that many novel acyl-CoAs will be discovered in the coming years. It is also likely that many novel roles in health and disease will be uncovered for these molecules.", "attr_mul": "{}", "attr_other": "{}"}

Third, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase oxidizes the alcohol group to a ketone and NADH is produced from NAD+. Finally, Thiolase cleaves between the alpha carbon and ketone to release one molecule of acetyl-CoA and a new acyl-CoA which is now 2 carbons shorter. This four-step process repeats until (5,7)-Decadienoyl-CoA has had all its carbons removed from the chain, leaving only acetyl-CoA. Beta oxidation, as well as alpha-oxidation, also occurs in the peroxisome. The peroxisome handles beta oxidation of fatty acids that have more than 20 carbons in their chain because the peroxisome contains very-long-chain Acyl-CoA synthetases and dehydrogenases. The heart primarily metabolizes fat for energy and Acyl-CoA metabolism has been identified as a critical molecule in early-stage heart muscle pump failure. Cellular acyl-CoA content also correlates with insulin resistance, suggesting that it can mediate lipotoxicity in non-adipose tissues. Acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) plays an important role in energy metabolism on account of key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis. The study of acyl-CoAs is an active area of research and it is likely that many novel acyl-CoAs will be discovered in the coming years.

More specifically, it is a deca-4_8-dienoic acid thioester of coenzyme A. (4,8)-decadienoyl-coa is an acyl-CoA with 10 fatty acid group as the acyl moiety attached to coenzyme A. Coenzyme A was discovered in 1946 by Fritz Lipmann (Journal of Biological Chemistry (1946) 162 (3): 743\u2013744) and its structure was determined in the early 1950s at the Lister Institute in London. Coenzyme A is a complex, thiol-containing molecule that is naturally synthesized from pantothenate (vitamin B5), which is found in various foods such as meat, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, eggs, and milk. More specifically, coenzyme A (CoASH or CoA) consists of a beta-mercaptoethylamine group linked to the vitamin pantothenic acid (B5) through an amide linkage and 3'-phosphorylated ADP. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process that requires four molecules of ATP, pantothenate and cysteine. It is believed that there are more than 1100 types of acyl-CoA\u2019s in the human body, which also corresponds to the number of acylcarnitines in the human body. Acyl-CoAs exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. The general role of acyl-CoA\u2019s is to assist in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. This process facilitates the production of fatty acids in cells, which are essential in cell membrane structure. Acyl-CoA's are also susceptible to beta oxidation, forming, ultimately, acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can enter the citric acid cycle, eventually forming several equivalents of ATP. In this way, fats are converted to ATP -- or biochemical energy. Acyl-CoAs can be classified into 9 different categories depending on the size of their acyl-group: 1) short-chain acyl-CoAs; 2) medium-chain acyl-CoAs; 3) long-chain acyl-CoAs; and 4) very long-chain acyl-CoAs; 5) hydroxy acyl-CoAs; 6) branched chain acyl-CoAs; 7) unsaturated acyl-CoAs; 8) dicarboxylic acyl-CoAs and 9) miscellaneous acyl-CoAs. Short-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with two to four carbons (C2-C4), medium-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with five to eleven carbons (C5-C11), long-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl-groups with twelve to twenty carbons (C12-C20) while very long-chain acyl-CoAs have acyl groups with more than 20 carbons. (4,8)-decadienoyl-coa is therefore classified as a medium chain acyl-CoA. The oxidative degradation of fatty acids is a two-step process, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase/synthase. Fatty acids are first converted to their acyl phosphate, the precursor to acyl-CoA. The latter conversion is mediated by acyl-CoA synthase. Three types of acyl-CoA synthases are employed, depending on the chain length of the fatty acid. (4,8)-decadienoyl-coa, being a medium chain acyl-CoA is a substrate for medium chain acyl-CoA synthase. The second step of fatty acid degradation is beta oxidation. Beta oxidation occurs in mitochondria and, in the case of very long chain acyl-CoAs, the peroxisome. After its formation in the cytosol, (4,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA is transported into the mitochondria, the locus of beta oxidation. Transport of (4,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA into the mitochondria requires carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which converts (4,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA into (4_8)-Decadienoylcarnitine, which gets transported into the mitochondrial matrix. Once in the matrix, (4_8)-Decadienoylcarnitine is converted back to (4,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA by CPT2, whereupon beta-oxidation can begin. Beta oxidation of (4,8)-Decadienoyl-CoA occurs in four steps.
